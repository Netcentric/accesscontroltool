## Overview
For better human readability and easy editing the ACL configuration files use the YAML format.

You can split your configuration to multiple files and directories. See also [best practices](BestPractices.md). Each folder can include one or more Yaml files ("*.yaml").
The file format is the same for all files.

You can find some examples in [example config package](../accesscontroltool-exampleconfig-package/src/main/jcr_root/apps/netcentric/actool-exampleconfig). The following sections document the most important aspects of the configuration files.
     
## Storage of configurations in JCR

This example shows three separate project specific configuration subnodes (multipleFiles, runmodes, simple) each containing one or more configuration files:

<img src="images/crx-storage.png">

The project specific configuration files are stored in JCR under a node which can be set in the OSGi configuration of the AcService (system/console/configMgr). Each folder underneath this location may contain `*.yaml` files that contain AC configuration. You can use a normal content package to deploy the files.

For some features the order of configuration files is relevant - the AC Tool orders the files alphabetically according their full path. 

## Run modes 

In general the parent node may specify a run mode spec (required run modes) after the first dot (```.```) of the YAMLs parent folder name. Run modes can be given as run mode spec as defined in <https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/sling-settings-org-apache-sling-settings.html#decisions-based-on-run-modes>. They can be composed using a `.` (AND operator, e.g. `myproject.author` will only become active on author). Additionally, multiple runmodes combinations can be given separated by comma (OR operator, binds less than AND) to avoid duplication of configuration (e.g. `myproject.author.test,author.dev` will be active on authors of dev and test environment only). Also each run mode can be negated by preceding it with a `-` (binds more than AND). The full grammar of the run mode spec looks like this in EBNF:

```
run mode spec ::= discjunction { "," disjunction }
disjunction ::= conjunction { '.' conjunction }
conjunction ::= notrunmode | runmode
notrunmode ::= '-' runmode
```

Examples:

* `project.author`: runs on "author" run mode only
* `project.author.dev`: runs only when run modes "author" and "dev" are present
* `project.author.test,author.dev`: requires run mode "author" and either "test" or "dev" to be present
* `project.-prod`: runs on any environment except for those which have the "prod" run mode

**In some cases it may be more appropriate to use the [`RUNMODES` variable](AdvancedFeatures.md#predefined-variables) inside YAML files (e.g. in case the configuration is only slightly different for different run modes). This variable can be used e.g. in [conditional entries](AdvancedFeatures.md#conditional-entries).**

## Overall structure a of an AC configuration file

<img src="images/configuration-file-structure.png">

Every configuration file comprises a group section where groups and their membership to other groups get defined and a ACE section where all ACEs in the repository regarding these groups get defined. The principal name of an ACE definition in each configuration file has to match a group id which is also defined in the same file. Groups which are contained in the `isMemberOf` property within a group definition have either to be defined in another configuration file or already be installed in the system on which the installation takes place.

## Configuration of groups

Groups are specified in the **group_config**. A group record in the configuration file starts with the group id followed by some indented data records containing properties like name/description and group membership. The groups created through the AC Tool always have a principal name equal to the given group id:

property | comment | required
--- | --- | ---
name | Name of the group as shown in UI. Sets the property `profile/givenName` of that group. | optional
description | Description of the group | optional
externalId | Required for AC setups since AEM 6.2 SP1 that synchronize groups from LDAP to AEM. The value has to be in format LDAP-DN;IDP-NAME where LDAP-DN is the full distinguished name and IDP-NAME is configured in OSGI config PID org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.security.authentication.ldap.impl.LdapIdentityProvider property "provider-name". Example: `externalId: "cn=group-name,ou=mydepart,ou=Groups,dc=comp,dc=com;IDPNAME"`. Since v1.9.3 | optional
path | Path of the intermediate node either relative or absolute. If relative, `/home/groups` is automatically prefixed. By default some implementation specific path is choosen. Usually the full group path is the (intermediate) path concatenated with a [randomized authorizable id](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/apidocs/org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/security/user/RandomAuthorizableNodeName.html).  | optional
isMemberOf | List of groups this groups is a member of. May be provided as yaml list or as comma-separated yaml string (*deprecated*, available to remain backwards compatible). | optional
memberOf | same meaning as `isMemberOf`. This property is *deprecated*, please use `isMemberOf` instead. | optional
members | List of groups that are member of this group. May be provided as yaml list or as comma-separated yaml string (*deprecated*, available to remain backwards compatible). Allows to specify the relationship from the other side compared to `isMemberOf`. **NOTE**: The `isMemberOf` configuration should be preferred over `members` if possible for better readability. Since `isMemberOf` shows what a group inherits, `members` would only show on the other side where permissions get pushed to. Also choosing one approach makes the config files consistent. `members` should therefore only be used in special cases where it is not possible to use `isMemberOf`, e.g. to push rights to a group that is not in the configuration and hence that group can not be annotated with `isMemberOf` | optional
migrateFrom | a group name assigned member users are taken over from | optional
virtual | If true, the group is *not* created in repository but only its permissions and isMemberOf relationships are made effective to other groups using the virtual group in isMemberOf. Flattens the effective group tree of users at runtime, but enlarges ACLs as set on path (instead of the virtual group, all referencing groups are listed in a particular path's ACL used by the virtual group). Useful for functionality fragments. False by default. Since v2.1.0 | optional
unmanaged* Properties | Only use sparsely and with care, see [Advanced Features](AdvancedFeatures.md)   | optional

Example:

```
- group_config:

  - myeditors:
    - isMemberOf: mystaff
      members: editor

  - system-read:
    - isMemberOf: 
      description: system users with read access
      path: fragments/system # if relative, /home/groups is automatically prefixed
      members: system-reader
```

### Group migration

The property 'migrateFrom' allows to migrate a group name without loosing their members. Members of the group given in migrateFrom are taken over and the source/old group is deleted afterwards. This property is only to be used temporarily. Usually, it is only included in one released version that travels all environments. Once all groups are migrated the migrateFrom property should be removed. If the property points to a group that does not exist (anymore) the property is ignored.

## Configuration of users

In general it is best practice to not generate regular users by the AC Tool but use other mechanism (e.g. LDAP) to create users. However, it can be useful to create system users (e.g. for replication agents or OSGi service authentiation) or test users on staging environments.

Users can be configured in the same way as groups  but in the **user_config** section. A user record in the configuration file starts with the user id followed by some indented data records containing properties. The users created through the AC Tool usually have a principal name equal to the given user id (except if externalId is provided, then the principal name is derived from that).

property | comment | required
--- | --- | ---
name | Works mostly like for groups, except that the string is split up in first and last name using the last space found in string. For instance "Johann Sebastian Bach" will result in first name "Johann Sebastian" and last name "Bach". For names where the split has to be explicitly configured, use a comma: "Van der Broek, Sebastian" will result in first name "Sebastian" and last name "Van der Broek". Sets the properties `profile/familyName` and `profile/givenName` of the user. | optional
path | Works exactly as for groups, except that the automatic prefix in case of relative paths is `/home/users`. | optional
isMemberOf | Works exactly as for groups | optional
description | Description of the user - will overwrite description in `profileContent` if provided there as well | optional
email | Email of the user - will overwrite email in `profileContent` if provided there as well | optional
password | The PW for the user (can only be set for regular users and not for system users). Is given either as plain text (only to be used for test users) or encrypted - use path `/system/console/crypto` on target instance to generate an encrypted password. Encrypted passwords have to be enclosed in brackets and should be quoted in yaml. Encrypted passwords are decrypted using com.adobe.granite.crypto.CryptoSupport by AC Tool during installation. | Optional, if left out the property `rep:password` is not set on user's node (authentication needs to happen without AEM password then, e.g. with LDAP)
isSystemUser | Create users as system user (AEM 6.1 and later) | optional
disabled | Can be set to `true` or an arbitrary reason string to disable a user. If set to `false` the user will be explicitly enabled (calling `User.disable(null)`). If omitted will not change anything regarding enabled/disabled status of user | optional
profileContent | Allows to provide [enhanced docview xml](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault/docview.html) that will reset the profile to the given structure after each run | optional
preferencesContent | Allows to provide [enhanced docview xml](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault/docview.html) that will reset the preferences node to the given structure after each run | optional
socialContent | Allows to provide [enhanced docview xml](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault/docview.html) that will reset the social node to the given structure after each run | optional
impersonationAllowedFor | List of users that may impersonate as this user. May be provided as yaml list or as comma-separated yaml string (*deprecated*). If this property is omitted the impersonators of the user remain untouched, otherwise impersonators are added as given in config (and existing ones not configured are removed). To force an empty list of impersonators, an empty yaml list may be used: `impersonationAllowedFor: []`. | optional
appendToKeyStore | Boolean flag determining whether the user's key store should be extended with the given keys or replaced with a new key store only containing the given `keys` (default) | option
keys | Public/Private key pairs which will be added to the user's key store. The keystore is transparently created if it does not exist yet during installation (with a random password). Useful in the context of configuring [Adobe IO in AEM](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/foundation/authentication/set-up-public-private-keys-for-use-with-aem-and-adobe-io.html) e.g. for [Adobe Launch via Adobe IO](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/aem_launch_adobeio_integration.html) or for the [SAML Integration in AEM](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/administering/using/saml-2-0-authenticationhandler.html). In general useful whenever the [AEM KeyStoreService](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/javadoc/com/adobe/granite/keystore/KeyStoreService.html) is being used. This property contains a number of keys, identified via their alias. The format of each key is described below. All encrypted private keys are stored not decrypted in the (encrypted) keystore. That means after they have been imported in AEM only the keystore password is necessary to access those.  | optional

Example:

```
- user_config:

  - editor:
    - isMemberOf: myeditors
      password: secret
      
  - replicationReceiver:
    - name: "Replication receiver"
      password: "{someEncryptedValue}"
      
  - poweruser:
    - name: "Power User"
      isMemberOf: powerusers
      password: secret
      path: myprojusers
      profileContent: <jcr:root jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured" email="poweruser@example.com"/>

  - system-reader:
    - name: system-reader
      isMemberOf: system-read
      path: system
      isSystemUser: true
      
  - userWithKeys:
    - name 'Test User with Keystore'
      isSystemUser: true
      path: system
      keys:
         my-alias:
              private: |
                  -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
                  ...
                  -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
              privatePassword: "{password}"
              public: |
                  -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                  ...
                  -----END PUBLIC KEY-----------
```

Group memberships can be set on user entry or group entry or both.

### Configuration of Keys
Each key entry in the `keys` section stands for a key alias in the key store. The alias name is given by the section name. As aliases are converted to lower-case only lower-case characters should be used. Each key section has the
 following properties

property | comment | required
--- | --- | ---
private | The encrypted PKCS#8 key in PEM format as defined in [RFC 7468](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468#section-11). Non-encrypted keys are not supported for security reasons! The symmetrical encryption requires the privatePassword to be decrypted. | yes
privatePassword | The password for decrypting the private key. The password itself must be encrypted with the AEM Crypto Support (i.e. encrypted with the AEM master key of the according instance). Therefore the value must start with `{`. Once the key is added to the keystore this password is no longer relevant as there the private key is encrypted with the password of the AEM keystore itself. | yes
public | The public DER key in PEM format as defined in [RFC 7468](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468#section-13). . If both `certificate` and `public` are set `certificate` takes precedence. | no (either public or certificate needs to be set)
certificate | The certificate in PEM format as defined in [RFC 7468](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468#section-5.1). If both `certificate` and `public` are set `certificate` takes precedence. | no (either public or certificate needs to be set)

It is recommended to store the values for `private`, `public` and `certificate` in the [YAML literal style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2795688) for readability reasons.

#### Creation of key pair
The key pair can be created e.g. with `ssh-keygen -m PKCS8`. Afterwards the public key needs to be converted to the right format with `ssh-keygen -f <public-key>.pub -e -m PEM >pubkey.pem`.

Usually keys are stage/environment-specific i.e. listed in run-mode specific yaml fragments. At least the encrypted `privatePassword` normally differs (due to the different Crypto Support master keys).

## Configuration of ACEs

The configurations are done per authorizableId (yaml key) followed by indented settings for each ACE. In the content ACEs, the user is referenced using its principal name, the mapping from configuration-provided authorizableId to principal name is performed by AC Tool (usually they are just equal, but when using `externalId` they differ). 

This data includes

property | comment | required
--- | --- | ---
path | A node path. Wildcards `*` are possible. e.g. assuming we have the language trees de and en then `/content/*/test` would match: `/content/de/test` and `/content/en/test` (mandatory). If an asterisk is contained then the path has to be written inside single quotes (`'...'`) since this symbol is a functional character in YAML. If path is not supplied the entry is used as repository level permission. | no
permission | the permission (either `allow` or `deny`) | yes
actions | the actions (`read,modify,create,delete,acl_read,acl_edit,replicate`). Reference: [Actions](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/administering/using/security.html#Actions) | either actions or privileges need to be present; also a mix of both is possible
privileges | the privileges (`jcr:read, rep:write, jcr:all, crx:replicate, jcr:addChildNodes, jcr:lifecycleManagement, jcr:lockManagement, jcr:modifyAccessControl, jcr:modifyProperties, jcr:namespaceManagement, jcr:nodeTypeDefinitionManagement, jcr:nodeTypeManagement, jcr:readAccessControl, jcr:removeChildNodes, jcr:removeNode, jcr:retentionManagement, jcr:versionManagement, jcr:workspaceManagement, jcr:write, rep:privilegeManagement`). References: [Oak Privileges](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/security/privilege.html) [JCR Privileges](https://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/spec/jcr/2.0/16_Access_Control_Management.html#16.2.3%20Standard%20Privileges) | either actions or privileges need to be present; also a mix of both is possible
repGlob |A [repGlob expression](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/security/authorization/restriction.html#Built-in_Restrictions) like "/jcr:*". Please note that repGlobs do not play well together with actions. Use privileges instead (e.g. "jcr:read" instead of read action). See [issue #48](https://github.com/Netcentric/accesscontroltool/issues/48). If the globbing expression starts with an asterisk, it has to be put between quotes. Using `repGlob` is a shortcut for `rep:glob` in sub element `restrictions` | no
restrictions|An associative array of restriction entries. Each entry uses the restriction name as key (e.g. `rep:glob`) and a literal as value. Values for multi-valued restrictions (like e.g. `rep:ntNames`) are also given as YAML string literals with commas separating each value (not using YAML arrays, in line with how isMemberOf is configured). Arbitrary restrictions are supported as long as they are supported by the underlying repository on which the installation takes place (validated before installation starts). For an overview of supported restrictions in different Oak versions see: [Oak Restriction Management](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/security/authorization/restriction.html#Built-in_Restrictions). Available from version 1.9.0.| no
initialContent | Allows to specify [enhanced docview xml](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault/docview.html) to create the path if it does not exist. The namespaces for jcr, sling and cq are added automatically if not provided to keep xml short. Initial content must only be specified exactly once per path (this is validated). If paths without permissions should be created, it is possible to provide only a path/initialContent tuple. See also [Providing Initial Content](AdvancedFeatures.md#providing-initial-content) | no
keepOrder | Defaults to false - use carefully only for special use cases as described in [Use Manual ACL Ordering](AdvancedFeatures.md#use-manual-acl-ordering) | no

Every new data entry starts with a "-".
The rules are sorted so that deny rules are always on top of allow rules. ACEs that are not part of the config file will not be reordered and stay on very top. This way allow rules are evaluated first, then deny rules and finally any system rules. 


Overall format

```
- [principal]
   - path: a valid node path in CRX
     permission: [allow/deny]
     actions: actions (optional, comma separated)
     privileges: privileges (optional, comma separated)  
     repGlob: GlobPattern (optional, path restriction as globbing pattern, shortcut for using rep:glob in restrictions)
     restrictions: Associative Array (optional, see below)
```

Entry with restrictions

```
- [principal]
   - path: a valid node path in CRX
     permission: [allow/deny]
     actions: actions (comma separated)
     privileges: privileges (comma separated)  
     restrictions: 
        rep:ntNames: nt:folder # rep:ntNames supports multiple values, but it's fine to supply only one value
        rep:itemNames: nodeName1,nodeName2,nodeName3 # multivalued
        rep:glob: GlobPattern # only one value may be supplied for this single-valued restriction
        # any supported restriction can be listed here
        # please note that if multiple restrictions are given, they are combined with "AND" (usually, only one is used per path entry)
```

Only ACEs for groups which are defined in the same configuration file can be installed. This ensures a consistency between the groups and their ACE definitions per configuration file.

Cq actions and jcr: privileges can be mixed. If jcr: privileges are already covered by cq actions within an ACE definition they get ignored. Also aggregated privileges like jcr:all or rep:write can be used.

Example:

```
- ace_config:

  - fragment-allow:

    - path: /content/myproject
      permission: allow
      actions: read,modify,create,delete,acl_read,acl_edit,replicate
      repGlob: */jcr:content*

    - path: '/content/myproject/*/articles'
      permission: allow
      actions: read,write
      privileges:
 
    - path: /content/mydemoproject
      permission: allow
      actions: read,write
      privileges: crx:replicate

  - fragment-deny:

    - path: /
      permission: deny
      actions: modify,create,delete,acl_read,acl_edit,replicate
```

In case the configuration file contains ACEs for groups which are not present in the current configuration no installation takes place and an appropriate error message gets displayed in the history log.

All important steps performed by the service as well as all error/warning messages get written to error log and history.

## Global Configuration 

Certain configuration aspects are global and can be configured on top level:

```
- global_config:
      minRequiredVersion: 1.8.5

```

Property | Description
--- | ---
minRequiredVersion | This configuration requires at least the given version of ACL tool. If an older version is found the configuration file is not processed.
... | See [Advanced Features](AdvancedFeatures.md) for more global options.

## Validation

First the validation of the different configuration lines is performed and gets applied while reading the file. Further validation consists of checking paths for existence as well as for double entries, checks for conflicting ACEs (e.g. allow and deny for same actions on same node), checks whether principals are existing under /home. If an issue is detected the reading is aborted and an appropriate error message is appended to the installation history and log.

If issues occur during the application of the configurations in CRX the installation has to be aborted and the previous state has to stay untouched. Therefore the session used for the installation only gets saved if no issues occurred thus persisting the changes.
